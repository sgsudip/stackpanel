<h3> <p>  <b class="p1"># About us and these terms</b></p></h3>


<ol>
<li class="p2">Welcome to ImageMarket, a subscription service for digital Items created by designers and creatives from around the world. When we say ‘we’, ‘us’ or ‘ImageMarket’ it’s because that’s who we are and we own and run the StockPanel platform.</li>
<li class="p2">When you create an ImageMarket account and accept these terms you become a member of our community. During your time with us you agree to follow the ground rules outlined in these terms so please read and understand them. If you don’t accept the terms then we’ll be sad, but you will need to leave because your presence on and use of the StockPanel platform is conditional on your acceptance to be bound by these terms whether you become a member or not.</li>
<li class="p2">The Items on ImageMarket are owned by the respective rightsholder.</li>

<h3> <p> <b class="p1"># How downloading and registering Items works</b></p></h3>



<li class="p2">What do you get when you download and register an Item?</li>
<ol>
<li class="p2">No ownership: By downloading or registering an Item you're not actually acquiring ownership of the Item itself, only the license to use that Item. Items are subject to specific terms of use, and these terms are set out in the license term.</li>
<li class="p2">Effect of point system: As ImageMarket is a pay-per-you-go service, certain rights granted under an Item license are only applicable for as long as your point (value or bonus) is active.
If you've registered Items for specific projects or end uses</li>
<li class="p2">Services: As a membership you also receive services from us like account support, fraud protection, library quality control and other related services.</li>
<li class="p2">Support: We do our best to make sure that Items are high quality. However, pls contact in working time for better support.</li>

<li class="p2">The redemption of a Third Party Offer is subject to terms and conditions set by our partners. You should read and make sure that you agree to the applicable terms and conditions before redeeming any Third Party Offer.</li>
<li class="p2">The description of products and services forming part of a Third Party Offer published on our site, and any associated links, have been provided to us by the suppliers. While we have made reasonable efforts to check the accuracy of the descriptions, the suppliers are solely responsible for any representations contained in those descriptions. Further, we do not endorse or assume any responsibility for those products and services.</li>

Your financial institution does the currency conversion and may charge you additional fees (we don’t control either the conversion rates or your financial institution’s fees).

<h3> <p>  <b class="p1"># Refunds and cancelations</b></p></h3>


<li class="p2">Given the nature of digital content, we do not generally offer a refund on a purchased points unless you not use any points (value or bonus). If you would like to request a refund you need to pay payment fee.</li>
<li class="p2">We will assess refund requests on their merits. There is generally no obligation to provide a refund or credit in situations like the following:</li>
<ol>
<li class="p2">you have changed your mind about your package;</li>
<li class="p2">you bought points by mistake;</li>
<li class="p2">you do not have sufficient expertise to use the Items made available;</li>
<li class="p2">you ask for goodwill; or</li>
</ol>
<li class="p2">If we decide to issue a refund, this will generally be done using the same manner used to make the purchase. Any payment made to you will be made in the currency ImageMarket offered to you when you purchased your points (either Euros or US Dollars), under the rules of the payment method (see section 12 - Currency conversion costs about currency conversion back to your local currency).

It is important that you understand how refunds work.</li>
