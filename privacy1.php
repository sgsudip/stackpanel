<h3> <p class="p1">  <b># Welcome to ImageMarket’s Privacy Policy</b></p></h3>
<ol>
<li class="p2">
Welcome to our privacy policy . This policy sets out how we handle your personal information if you’re an ImageMarket user or visitor to our Sites. It applies across ImageMarket (the “Sites”).
</li>
<li class="p2">
When we say ‘we’, ‘us’ or ‘ImageMarket’ it’s because that’s who we are and we own and run the Sites.
</li>
<li class="p2">
If we say ‘policy’ we’re talking about this privacy policy. If we say ‘user terms’ we’re talking about the rules for using each of the Sites. The rules vary by product and each product makes them separately available and seeks consent to them separately to this policy.
</li>

<h3> <p class="p1">  <b># The type of personal information we collect</b></p></h3>
<li class="p2">We collect certain personal information about visitors and users of our Sites.</li>
<li class="p2">The most common types of information we collect include things like: user-names, member names, email addresses, IP addresses, other contact details, survey responses, photos, payment information such as payment agent details, transactional details, content you direct us to make available on our Sites (such as item descriptions), your actions on our Sites (including any selections or inputs into items) and web and email analytics data. We will also collect personal information from job applications (such as, your CV, the application form itself, cover letter and interview notes).</li>

<h3> <p class="p1">  <b># How we collect personal information</b></p></h3>
<li class="p2">We collect personal information directly when you provide it to us, automatically as you navigate through the Sites, or through other people when you use services associated with the Sites.</li>
<li class="p2">We collect your personal information when you provide it to us when you complete membership registration and buy or provide items or services on our Sites, subscribe to a newsletter, email list, submit feedback, enter a contest, fill out a survey, or send us a communication.</li>
<h3> <p class="p1">  <b># Personal information we collect about you from others</b></p></h3>

<li class="p2">Although we generally collect personal information directly from you, on occasion, we also collect certain categories of personal information about you from other sources. In particular:</li>
<ol>
<li class="p2">financial and/or transaction details from payment providers located in the US, UK, and Australia in order to process a transaction;</li>
<li class="p2">third party service providers (like Google, Facebook) who are located in the US or UK, which may provide information about you when you link, connect, or login to your account with the third party provider and they send us information such as your registration and profile from that service, this only occurs if you are using ImageMarket Studio. The information varies and is controlled by that service provider or as authorized by you via your privacy settings at that service provider
