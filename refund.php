<h3> <p class="p1">  <b># Refund Policy - ImageMarket</b></p></h3>

<blockquote>
<p id="text">
In case you might want to request back the amount or if you've paid by mistake, we encourage you to reach out to us with the transaction ID to our <a href="contact.php">contact page</a> or by email at <b>contact@imagemarket.xyz.</b> <br> <br>

We'll try and get back to you within a week, and refund the amount to your bank only if the credits were unused (not spent on any downloads). <br> <br>

If the credits have been used, we can further discuss about partial refund to help and serve you better. <br>
<hr>
Please note that payments made through cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin etc.) can not be refunded, however we will assist further if there's some error on our side which shows the payment as failed transaction. <br>
We encourage you to reach out to us with the transaciton ID, and we'll try our best to resolve it manually. </p>
